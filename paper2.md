## Prevalence of hovering
In a questionnaire administered in Taiwan by \citet{taiwan}, only about half (53.5\%) of participants reported that they usually use a seated posture when they use public sitting-style toilets. The two main alternatives were hovering (31.3\%) squatting (15.2\%).

In a survey of British gynaecological outpatients ($n=528$) \citep{moore1991},
85\% of participants indicated that they hovered at public toilets,
12\% indicated that they sat after covering the seat with toilet paper
and 2\% indicated that they sat directly on the seat.
The numbers were 37\%, 5\% and 59\%, respectively, when
participants were asked about their practices when
using a toilet at a friend's house.
%Also, 70\% of participants indicated that their mothers
%had taught them not to sit directly on public toilets.

Hovering is known to be prevalent among
Taiwanese people \citep{taiwan} and
British gynaecological outpatients \citep{moore1991},
but research as to its prevalance a more general
population from a Western country is lacking.
