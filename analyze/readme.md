I made a table on paper for studying model fit; this is the
analog-model-fit-graph tag.

## To do
Compute P(dirty in this scenario|dirty in that scenario) and 
P(dirty in this scenario|dirty in those scenarios) and predict
people based on the product of these probabilities. This is
the thing that I was calling ranking.

Make a chart showing the decision process. This might be an ordinary but pretty
decision tree diagram.

## Which source files are relevant

Little of this repository is actually used for the final paper. To see what's
relevant, check out the files `build.r` and `paper.Rmd`.
