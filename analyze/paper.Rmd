## Introduction
Western sitting-style toilets are presumably intended to be used in a seated
position, (McClelland & Ward, 1982) except when used by males for exclusively urination.
But the word on the street is that people often adopt a hovering posture
instead of the seated posture in order to cope with unsanitary toilets.

One person admitted to PostSecret that he or she hasn't sat on a toilet for the
[four years](http://www.flickr.com/photos/withinreason/2593730231/), and this
sparked [some](http://www.postsecretcommunity.com/chat/viewtopic.php?t=98076)
[discussion](http://www.postsecretcommunity.com/chat/viewtopic.php?t=98095)
on PostSecret forums.
There's even a website that reviews toilets and tells
you whether to [Sit or Squat](https://www.sitorsquat.com/).

Also, I recently remarked that sitting is unpleasant because the toilet seat
tends to be colder than I would like. But other people don't seem to bring
this reason up in conversation or in writing.

Greed (Greed, 1995) and Moore (Moore & al, 1991) anecdotally found that young ladies
are often taught that hovering is proper and that sitting is unclean. 
[Several](http://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Public-Restroom)
[WikiHow](http://www.wikihow.com/Urinate-Standing-up-As-a-Female)
[articles](http://www.wikihow.com/Safely-Use-a-Public-Bathroom)
provide examples of this phenomenon.

Formal quantitative studies have found hovering to be common among
Taiwanese people (Cai & You, 1998) and
British gynaecological outpatients  (Moore & al, 1991),

### The hovering cycle

Many of the referenced forum discussions explain that hovering, rather than
sitting, creates more of a mess. Presumably, this is because hovering puts the
relevant body parts in a less stable position that is higher above the toilet,
making it harder to aim.

If these anecdotes about the causes and effects of hovering are correct, then
the clean toilet is an unstable equilibrium of a toilet's sanitary state;
toilets get dirty, so people hover, so the toilets get dirty, so people hover.

![Cycle of hovering and toilet cleanliness](https://raw.github.com/tlevine/toilet-posture-toilet-hackers-presentation/master/2-cycle.png)

In other contexts, this cycle is sometimes termed the
"[broken windows theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)",
or the feeling of "[maintenance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_prevention_through_environmental_design)" of a space.

### Effects of privacy on posture choice

I focused on this broken windows theory in the current paper, but I also thought
about other impacts on posture. Anecdotes suggest that public toilets tend to be
dirtier than private toilets, or people or at least more concerned with
sanitation at public toilets than at private toilets  (Cai & You, 1998), so we might
expect that a more public toilet would effect posture similarly to how a more
dirty toilet would.

On the other hand, privacy might have a secular impact on posture choice.
For example, social norms might have more of an impact in public toilets than
in private toilets.
A lady once told me that she thought people would be more likely to hover at
public toilets because hovering is considered more proper than sitting; since
people can see others' feet and lower legs under the bathroom stalls in public
restrooms, people might be more likely to follow this convention of hovering
in public than in private.

### Goals
Understanding the mechanisms of toilet cleanliness can help us design and
maintain efficient toilets that people want to use, so it would be nice to
see whether this the broken windows theory explains toilet sanitation issues.

I sought to establish whether this cycle of hovering and toilet
dirt exists by looking at the postures that university students say they'd
use in toilet-use scenarios of differing privacy and cleanliness.
I was mainly concerned with how cleanliness influenced the decision
of what posture to use, but I tried to separate effects of privacy
from effects of cleanliness.

### Terms
Western toilets typically consist of a bowl and a seat with a large hole in the
middle. The seat typically can lie on the bowl or be lifted above the bowl.
I consider four categories of postures in which this contraption can be used.

#### Sitting
Sitting-style toilets are designed
to be used in a seated posture  (McClelland & Ward, 1982),
which we define as one where the buttocks or thighs touch the toilet.

#### Hovering
Hovering, also called squatting or semi-squatting, describes postures where the
feet are on the floor but the buttocks and thighs are above the toilet. This is
accomplished through knee extension and trunk flexion. (Greed, 2003)

#### Squatting
In squatting, the thighs touch the legs and the trunk touches or nearly touches
the thighs.  In order to accomplish this on a sitting-style toilet, one puts his
or her feet on the toilet seat. This is probably much less common in countries
where sitting toilets are the norm.

Confusingly, term "squatting" is also often used to refer to what I term "hovering".

#### Standing
Males commonly stand at toilets when they are urinating.
In this posture, the person faces the toilet and stands in front of the toilet.

## Methods
In May 2011, I sent a questionnaire to randomly selected Cornell University students
(graduate and undergraduate). The questionnaire asked more questions than I
presently present, but I'll just explain the relevant questions.

### Questions
I asked each participant for his or her sex. Participants were required to
choose the more appropriate of "male" or "female". I also asked each participant
what posture he or she would use in 12 different scenarios. For each scenario,
the participant was required to respond with one of these postures:

* Sit
* Hover
* Squat
* Stand
* Other

The 12 scenarios came from a three variables in a $$2\times2\times3$$ layout.
The variables were

* Privacy level (public or private)
* Cleanliness (dirty, clean or unspecified)
* Task (urinate or defecate)

For example, one question was

> If you are urinating at a very dirty private toilet, which posture are you
> most likely to use?

The "unspecified" cleanliness level meant that cleanliness level was not
mentioned; for example, another question was

> If you are urinating at a public toilet, which posture are you
> most likely to use?

### Validity testing
I pilot-tested the questionnaire on nine people. For each of
these pilot test participants, I asked the participant to complete the
questionnaire, and then I interviewed the participants to see how they
had interpreted each of the questions. I made some changes based on this
pilot study, but all of the students responded the same in person as they
had on the questionnaire. I found the participants in the psychology
department's participant pool.

### Main sample
I selected random students from the school's public electronic directory.
(It's the same directory as the one from [this study](/!/middle-names/) on
middle names at Cornell University.

I sent emails to 390 students. The emails asked the participants to
complete the questionnaire online in exchange for a one-in-three chance
of winning $10. For students who did not respond, I sent up to two
reminder emails.

### Reliability testing
A week after the survey emails were sent, I selected the 20 people who
had responded first. I sent them a very similar email asking that they
take the questionnaire again in order to test it's reliability. These
participants received the same compensation as they had received in the
main survey phase---another one-in-three chance at winning $10, even if
they had won before.

## Results
Of the 390 students to which questionnaires were sent, 173 completed the
questionnaire. There were 103 females and 70 males.
<!-- select sex, count(*) from demographic where questionnaire_round = 'test' group by sex;  -->

### Popularity of posture by situation
Within each of the 12 situations, the most popular posture was normally
sitting. This makes sense given that they are called "sitting toilets".
Notable exceptions are when men are urinating (They stand) and when women are
urinating at dirty or public toilets. This first series of eight plots looks at the
four situations of unspecified cleanliness for each of the two sexes.

```{r pie-matrix-1, echo=F}
pie.matrix.pretty
```

The table below presents the popularity of the two most popular
postures for each situation. By "popularity", I mean the proportion of
Cornell University students who would say they use the posture if I
asked.

```{r posture-table, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
markdown.data.frame(paper.table.book)
```

The "other" option was especially popular for dirty toilet situations.
I suspect that participants chose this to indicate that they would never
ever under any circumstances ever use such a toilet.

### Reducing dimensionality
I converted the categorical "posture" variable into a binary "dirty posture"
variable. I considered "hover" and "other" to be dirty, and I considered
"sit" to be clean. I considered "stand" to be dirty unless it was marked
by a male for a scenario involving urination. (Standing is actually
[pretty](http://sormlandlandsting.vansterpartiet.se/files/2011/05/motion-k%C3%B6nl%C3%B6sa-toaletter.pdf)
[dirty](/!/risley-toilets/),
and some males
[choose to sit](http://isitnormal.com/story/peeing-sitting-down-920/),
but I see standing as the conventional, baseline posture for these scenarios.)
Nobody had marked "squat", so that didn't need to be converted.

That results in this table.
```{r dirtyposture-table-setup, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
.t <- dcast(posture.df, sex + privacy + task + cleanliness ~ dirtyposture, value.var = 'dirtyposture', fun.aggregate = length)
.t$p <- paste(.t[,'1'] / rowSums(.t[,c('0', '1')]))
.t$count <- .t[,'1']
```
```{r dirtyposture-table, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
markdown.data.frame(.t[c('sex', 'privacy', 'task', 'cleanliness', 'count', 'p')])
```

### Does dirt promote dirt?
The above table about the use of dirty postures versus clean postures
gives us an answer this question. If dirty toilets promote dirty postures,
we should expect the rate of dirty postures to increase as toilets get
dirtier. The difference is quite strong, so I could use a low-powered but
easily-interpreted method to check that the difference was significant.

I estimated a 95% confidence interval based on a normal approximation
of the binomial distribution. I conservatively assumed that the proportion
was $$0.5$$ when computing the standard error. Also conservatively, I only
computed it for the male sub-sample ($$n = 70$$ rather than $$n = 173$$).

$$SE\left(p)\right) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\times\left(1 - \hat{p}\right)}{n - 1}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5^2}{69}}$$

Then multiply it by $$z = 2$$ in each direction to get 12%, so we can
be quite confident that these percentages figures are within 12% of the
actual. Well actually, because of the confidence level I chose, we
should expect the proportion for one of the 24 above-tabulated scenarios
to fall outside confidence interval.

This tells us that Cornell students in general are more likely to use dirty
postures as toilets get dirtier.

### Do public toilets affect posture choice for reasons other than dirt?
I checked simply whether posture was the same between the corresponding
public and private conditions for each participant. This is six
comparisons per participant, for each of the cleanliness $$\times$$ task
combinations.

There were instances where posture was different, so the quick answer is
"yes". But how often were they different? To avoid talking in double-negatives,
I actually checked how often the posture was the same. Here are the raw
proportions.

```{r privacy-crosstabs, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
markdown.data.frame(privacy.crosstabs)
```

I also plotted them, separating by sex. The error bars are 12% tall in
each direction; the reasoning for this is the same as in the earlier
table.

```{r privacy-plot, echo = F}
privacy.p
```

In most situations, the figures are quite close to 100%, but a couple are
quite relatively low. In particular, the figure is 50% for females in the
unspecified-urinate condition; this is to say that half of females who
responded to the questionnaire said they would use a different posture
when "urinating at a private toilet" than when "urinating at a public toilet".

I was originally not so concerned with the difference between sexes, but it
seems interesting now, so let's run some fancy significance test. I fit a
multivariate analysis of variance. Sex was the sole independent variable,
and the correspondence of postures between the six sets of corresponding
public and private scenarios were the response variables. I haven't figured
out a straightforward way of writing that, so here are three rows from the
response variable matrix.

```{r privacy-manova-df, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
markdown.data.frame(privacy.person.df[1:3,-(1:2)])
```

Cells say "TRUE" if posture was the same in the corresponding public and
private scenarios, and they say "FALSE" if it wasn't.

```{r privacy-manova, echo = F}
privacy.manova
for (.test in c("Pillai", "Wilks", "Hotelling-Lawley", "Roy")) {
    print(summary(privacy.manova, test = .test))
}
summary.aov(privacy.manova)
```

The MANOVA doesn't tell us anything we didn't already figure out from
the graph; all of the MANOVA significance tests find a difference by sex
in joint rate of correspondence across scenarios, and univariate
ANOVAs on the six respective variables indicate significant differences
for the unspecified_urinate, clean_defecate and clean_urinate conditions
These are the three that are obviously different based on the graph.

Using MANOVA actually isn't quite appropriate because it treats the response
variables as continuous rather than being only one or zero. It would be
more appropriate to use [generalized estimating equations](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v15/i02/paper),
but I don't really know how those work and don't care enough right now.
Because of this inappropriateness, the residuals are negatively skewed,

I wouldn't worry too much about the validity of the MANOVA, but you should
keep in mind that I might not really be distinguishing between privacy
and cleanliness.
Considering the nature of the data collection, it is hard to tell whether
this analysis really does disentangle toilet privacy and toilet cleanliness.
Participants were asked about "clean private toilet[s]" and
"clean public toilet[s]", and they could have interpret the word "clean"
differently in the two contexts; a clean public toilet might just be
clean relative an ordinary public toilet. If participants saw
clean private toilets as cleaner than clean public toilets, this result
about the difference between public and private scenarios doesn't separate
the effect of cleanliness from the other effects of the privacy of the space.

Anyway, it appears that a toilet being dirty doesn't affect posture much after
I control for everything else. The situations where it does effect posture are
when females are in the less unpleasant situations of urinating at non-dirty
toilets.

### Characterizing people
The analysis thus far has looked for changes by scenario, across people.
For example, I found that more people use dirty postures (mostly hover)
when toilets are dirty. I haven't yet looked at all at how particular people
change their postures as scenarios change. Said differently, I haven't
looked at whether the people who hover when toilets are clean are the
same as the people who hover when toilets are dirty.

#### Plots by person
First, I made a separate plot for each participant to characterize that
participant's posture choice. XXX Add a link.

Flipping through all of those is sort of interesting, but I would like
to condense the trends into something more easily digested.

It seems like we can vaguely order the various scenarios in a particular
way such that we can usually split the scenarios at two along that ordering
and find that a person uses dirty postures at most scenarios on one side
and uses clean postures at most scenarios on the other side. More on that later.

#### Clusters
I used hierarchical clustering to group the participants based on their
responses to the twelve questions. I used the Ward method with
euclidean distances. The grouping looks like this.

```{r basic-dendrogram, echo = F}
plot(
    fit.participant$hclust, axes = F, xlab = '', ylab = '', sub = '',
    main = 'Hierarchical clustering of participants based on questionnaire responses'
)
```

We can cut off this dendrogram at any level and look at the average
(really the centroid) value within each cluster. If we cut it before
the first split and have one "cluster", the centroid will just be the
the values in the table in the
"Do public toilets affect posture choice for reasons other than dirt?"
section, except not grouped by sex. (I clustered based on question
responses only, not based on sex.)

I cut off the dendrogram at successively lower levels until it got boring,
annotating the clusters as I went. Here's the first cut.

```{r a-2-plot-raw, echo = F}
.a.2 <- annotate.k(fit.participant, 2) 
```

And here are the centroids. (I didn't cluster based on sex, but I included sex
in the table below.)

```{r a-2-table, echo = F}
.a.2$centroids
```

After studying the centroids, I came up with these groupings.

```{r a-2-plot, echo = F}
.junk <- a.2()
```

Here it is at six clusters.

```{r a-6-plot, echo = F }
.a.6 <- a.6()
```

```{r a-6-table, echo = F, results = 'asis' }
markdown.data.frame(.a.6$centroids)
```

And I stopped at 17.

```{r a-17-plot, echo = F}
.junk <- a.17()
```

The above groupings help us understand the questionnaire responses by person,
but they don't tell us how well the groupings might apply to people outside
the sample. To check how robust these groups are,
I used approximately unbiased p-values, computed by multiscale bootstrap
resampling in [pvclust](http://www.is.titech.ac.jp/~shimo/prog/pvclust/). I only vaguely know how this works:
Resamples of varied sizes are taken from my 173-person
sample, and the stability of the results from these resamples is computed.

It found most of those last 17 clusters to be significant, (That is, we wouldn't
have seen them unless they're real.) with approximately
unbiased p-values greater than 0.95. Unexcitingly, the p-values were zero for
most of the higher clusters. Though I don't really know how this technique works,
I suspect that this result is somewhat explained by my use of cluster analysis
to describe binary (yes/no) data. Anyway, I thus don't have a particularly
good confidence figure for the clustering.

#### Counts of dirty postures by person
Having looked so much at the within-person relationships between different the
scenarios, what general things can we say about the way people make decisions?

The plots and clustering generally suggest that a particular person is more
likely to use a dirty posture as the toilet changes from clean to dirty and
from private to public. Also, a particular female is more likely to use a
dirty posture when she urinates at than when she defecates at an equivalent
toilet.

Said differently,

* If a person uses a dirty posture at a private toilet, he or she probably uses
    a dirty posture at an equivalent public toilet. (But the converse is not true.)
* If a person uses a dirty posture at a dirty toilet, he or she probably uses
    a dirty posture at an equivalent cleaner toilet. (But the converse is not true.)
* Males rarely use dirty postures when urinating.
* If a female uses a dirty posture when defecating, she probably uses a dirty
    posture when urinating at the same toilet. (But the converse is not true.)

Recall that each participant marked what posture they would most likely use
in each of twelve scenarios and that the postures were grouped into clean
and dirty postures. Since we are able to narrow down the marginal reasons why
a person would switch postures, the following plot is informative.

```{r p-ndirty, echo = F}
p.ndirty
```

The x-axis is the number of questions for which dirty
postures were marked, and the y-axis is the proportion of participants.
There is a separate curve for each sex, and the area under each curve is 100%.
Because males rarely use dirty postures when urinating, it might make sense
to think of the male curve as ending at six questions rather than at twelve.

For both sexes, most people rarely use dirty postures. On the
other hand, few people always use clean postures. Moreover, based on our
ranking of the different scenarios, it seems that about half of people of
either sex will use dirty postures in the dirty scenarios and only in the
dirty scenarios.

#### General trends
As I just said, a particular person is more likely to use a dirty posture as
the toilet changes from clean to dirty and from private to public. Also,
a particular female person is more likely to use a dirty posture when she urinates
at than when she defecates at an equivalent toilet.

These conclusions match the conclusions based on the aggregated rates of use
of the various postures, but these are at the level of participants rather than
the level of the group of participants. Previously, we only could say
that more people are likely to hover as toilets get dirtier; now, it appears
that particular individuals are more likely to hover as toilets get dirtier.
(That might sound like common sense.)

### Reliability testing
I sent a second questionnaire to 20 people, and 16 responded. For each
person's response to each question, I checked whether the responses from
the two rounds matched each other.

```{r reliability-cast, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
markdown.data.frame(reliability.cast)
```
For the least consistent question, 13 out of the 16 people (81%) had the same
response for both rounds. So the responses were quite consistent between the
test and retest questionnaires.

## Thoughts

### Broken windows

At the beginning of this paper, I presented the following hypothesis.

> Toilets get dirty, so people hover, so toilets get dirty.

The present study supports this hypothesis; people were more likely to
say that they'd hover or use a different dirtying posture at dirty or
public toilets than at clean or private toilets.
This was true both when we looked at the group as a whole, not considering
changes within a person, and when we looked at the level of individual persons.

For a more complete
verification of this hypothesis, another study could observe how
posture choice affects the dirtying of the toilet and see whether my
categorization of postures into clean postures and dirty postures is
reasonable.

### Decision processes

The study also gives us an idea of how people might decide whether to hover when
using a public toilet or a dirty toilet.

Dirtier toilets and more public toilets encourage hovering and other dirty
postures. I tried separating the effects of cleanliness and privacy, and there
might be a difference, but the manner in which the questions were asked makes
it difficult to claim whether I have truly isolated the effect of privacy.

Men and women are both unlikely to
hover while defecating, presumably because it is difficult. This might change
if toilets were designed in ways that made hovering easier or harder.

### Men and women

Moreover, the study shows how the cleanliness of a bathroom might affect
different groups differently.

When using a clean or private toilet ("pleasant toilet" henceforth),
people are more likely to use a clean posture.

For use of an dirty or public ("unpleasant") toilet, the differences between males
and females become relevant. For defecation, both sexes generally
choose to sit. For urination, men generally choose to stand, and
women generally choose to hover. This switch demonstrates a
compromise between sanitary comfort and musculoskeletal comfort.

People would prefer not to have to touch the unpleasant toilet.
Men and women pee in different ways and thus accomplish this in
different ways; men stand, and women hover. Standing is
presumably much easier than hovering, so most men stand during
urination, while only about half of women hover. (The rest mostly sits.)
Men and women defecate more similarly, so when they switch to
defecation, the rates of clean and dirty postures are closer.
The rates are still a bit higher for women, though; it might be
that women have more practice in hovering and thus are more
likely to hover at an unpleasant toilet.

The current study compared males and females, but loads of other things that
could affect how people use a toilet. These things include anthropometry,
fatigue and disabilities.

### Toilet design

Toilets are called "sitting" toilets, but lots of people hover,
even in the most desirable of conditions. Something is wrong here.
The design and conventions of toilets do not match the way that
toilets are used. Let's consider changing that.

If people want to hover, maybe we should let them hover. Would
adding bars to stalls help people hover? And would that, in turn,
make people happier?

Maybe we can make toilets fit a wider range of people. Men have
the luxury of calmly standing while urinating, whereas women have
to either hover or bear touching the seat. Could toilets be
designed in some way that matched the female anatomy? Clara Greed
 (Greed, 2003) might give you us ideas. More generally, can we
design healthful toilets that still align with our cultural
expectations? Alexander Kira (Kira, 1976) has ideas on that.

The insistence on hovering over a public toilet can also be seen
as a silly obsession with cleanliness. Sitting on the public
toilet is probably perfectly safe, and hovering is known to
have undesirable health outcomes, like
taking longer to pee  (Moore & al, 1991).

As an aside, we should consider squatting. Among other benefits,
it might make peeing faster. (Amjadi & al, 2006; Rane & Corstiaans, 2008)
On the other hand, it might not. (Unsal & Cimentepe, 2004)

Maybe we should just get over this.
Alternatively, maybe we can keep toilets from feeling dirty.

### Keeping toilets clean

Public bathrooms are notoriously dirty.
(They even scare children. (Vernon & al, 2003; Lundblad & Hellström, 2005))
The present study
provides insights into how we can efficiently reduce this dirt.
The current study has related the broken windows theory to the
cleanliness of bathrooms. When people use dirty bathrooms,
they tend to use postures that make toilets dirtier. Thus,
clean bathrooms stay clean, but dirty bathrooms get dirtier.

Rather than cleaning bathrooms once a day or waiting until
they get messy, consider quickly tidying them up every hour
or so; wipe the toilets and the sinks, pick trash up from the
ground, and flush any toilets that haven't been flushed.
This may stop toilets from getting particularly dirty,
allowing toilets to stay reasonably clean throughout the day
without major cleaning.

### Trivia

The estimated prevalences of various postures of toilet use
(For example, 54% of women hover when urinating in public toilets.)
might make for fun dinner conversation.

## Helpful tools

I ran the questionnaire on [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/).
Qualtrics gave me a verbose and denormalized spreadsheet, so I
I used [SQLite](http://sqlite.org) and [dumptruck](http://www.dumptruck.io)
to import the data, then I studied everything in R, using 
[ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net),
`hclust`,
[cluster](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cluster/index.html),
[pvclust](http://www.is.titech.ac.jp/~shimo/prog/pvclust/),
`manova`,
and all of [Hadley](http://had.co.nz/)'s libraries.
The paper is mostly compiled with
[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and
[R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/r_markdown).
