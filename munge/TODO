## DumpTruck

I think there's a bug in dumptruck that I introduced in the zipping
endeavour.

## Tompkins County

The Tompkins County question seems to have reversed responses; the question
is phrased such that a positive response indicates living in Tompkins County,

> Did you live in Tompkins County during the last three months (the spring 2011 semester)?

so most of the responses should be positive, but most of the responses are
actually negative responses (coded 0 rather than 1).

## Toilet seat position

Six of the responses to the toilet seat position question are the empty string.
How did that happen? I suspect that three are from people who did not consent
and three are from people who didn't click the box because the questionnaire
did not force completion of the question.
